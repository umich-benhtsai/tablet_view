        <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
        <p>
          Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers
          over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife
          and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half
          the world's active geysers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among
          the tourists. Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by
          getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
          bad decisions by visiting

        <h3>Geographical Location: Europe</h3>
        <p>
          Jungfrau is a city in Switzerland known for its mountain summits
          nicknamed the “top of Europe.” It is very famous also for its railway
          created in 1912 that can bring you to a height of 3454m. At the summit
          there are outstanding views where you can see the whole city and
          beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scenery consists of valleys, waterfalls, rock walls, and snow
          peaks. When visiting, it is vital to go on a day with good weather
          because it enhances the quality of the views. Hiking is very popular
          at short trails called Grutschalp and Murren. A very common tourist
          attraction is also exploring the Lauterbrunnen valley.

        <p>
          Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America's first National Lakeshore,
          is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan's beautiful
          Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly
          100 miles of trails, everyone can find something to enjoy at Pictured
          Rocks!
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured
          Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit required).
          Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is
          from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the
          Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view
          the changing leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state
          regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings
          otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing,
          skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter activities. Check
          road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the
          winter. Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail!

          Dublin City is the capital city of the Republic of Ireland and is

          settlement called Dubh Linn which translates to black pool. Dublin has
          always been a historically significant city in Irish history, from
          being the main city from which the British ruled over Ireland for 800
          years to then being the setting of the 1916 Easter Rising and Irish
          War of Independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today Dublin is a developed city boasting one of the strongest tech
          sectors in Europe and a booming tourism industry. Dublin is renowned
          for its sites such as the GPO, Croke Park, O'Connell Street, Temple
          Bar and Saint James Gate, which is where Guinness is brewed. Dublin is
          also surrounded by great coastal towns such as Dun Laoghaire, Howth
          and Skerries.
