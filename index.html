        <p>
          Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an
          obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every
          single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a
          seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very
          scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was
          nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his
          own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat,
          despite being middle-aged.

        <h2>Milktea</h2>
        <img src="images/Main.JPG" width="400" alt="Milktea taking nap" />
        <p>
          Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves
          her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She
          makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a
          loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it
          probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been
          empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic
          disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against
          keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they
          reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints
          and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is
          living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty
          while sacrificing the animals’ health.

        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.

        <p>
          Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a
          gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and
          malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after
          some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!
        </p>
        <p>
          My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard
          time getting used to the large house since we were previously living
          in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run
          around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.

        <p>
          Riley is a 2yr old goldendoodle. He is very active and loves
          attention. Riley can be pretty mischievous; as such, his favorite
          activity is begging for (or stealing) food, however getting cuddled on
          a cool floor comes as a close second. In addition, Riley loves to walk
          in his local park or hang out with his best friend Cosmo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Riley would NOT survive in the wild. He is very stubborn, jealous, and
          pampered. He’s currently in his “terrible twos,” and must get
          everything his way. That said, Riley is loved by his family as a
          perfect, funny, and loyal dog.

          He has an abundance of toys but only likes to play with a couple. He
          enjoys going on walks and especially on trails in the woods. He has a
          few dog friends that he likes to go on playdates with as well.

        <p>
          Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours
          a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods of time, they
          naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their
          inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy
          socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of
          five to ten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run
          around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage
          for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and
          he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting
          at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.
